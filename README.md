# Predict_Student-Academic_Dropout
Education institutions always have to deal with the difficulty of making sure that students advance successfully, recognising those who are at danger, and acting quickly to support students' academic journeys. This project's main objective is to give educational institutions predictive insights on student outcomes so they may take proactive steps to reduce dropout rates and increase graduation rates.This research uses machine learning and predictive analytics to estimate academic outcomes for students, such as whether they will continue their studies after dropping out or graduate.
